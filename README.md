# SpaceInvadersApril
Games Job Fair Spring 2023 - Unreal Engine Programming Challenge


Contestants are challenged with creating a "Space Invaders" type of game.

Gameplay mechanics and core logic should be written in C++.
There should be three visually different enemy types, but all behave the same.
An enemy can shoot if no other enemy is in front of it.
Additionally a UFO will sometimes go across the top of the screen which the player can shoot for bonus points.
Enemies move left or right as a group and shift downward and change direction every time they reach the screen's edge.
Enemy group speed gradually increases as enemies are destroyed.
The player has three lives.
The game saves the highest score between sessions.
In each advancing level the enemies start one row lower, unless already at the lowest possible one.
Above the player are "bunkers" which get eroded when shot at by either the player or enemies, or if they get touched by enemies.
Cite your sources in your code comments if you use code/methods from elsewhere.
You're allowed to use Quixel Megascans or marketplace assets as long as they're assets only (no code or BP).
Only one game entry allowed per participant (no team entries).
Feel free to change the visual theme of the game (it doesn't have to be in space).
